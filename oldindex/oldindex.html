<h3>About Me</h3>

<u>What you need to know.</u>
<p>I have been on the internet for not too long, I first got broadband in 2012, a $10 dollar a month connection that I still have today (thanks Comcast Economy for the 15/2 mbps) </p>
<p>I have specialized in computers and hope for it to be my line of work in the near future, I have not gotten extremely good at one field or another. However I have tried almost everything. Coding, Audio and Video production, Video Game Developing, Etc Etc Etc. </p>
<p> As of now, my main fun is just talking on discord and sometimes modding and creating Source Mods (HL2 Mods) but I still like coding and doing things like making this website. </p>
<p> I don't like spending money on virtual things as much anymore, trust me I learned the hard way that a Steam Level, WoW account, $1200 Xbox Live Account, etc, doesn't matter in the real world. I've invested more into clothes, school, and generally less games and subscriptions.</p>
<p> However, I still value my time online and spend about 90% of my time on my computer, but i'm not a neckbeard faggot. I lift weights, fuck bitches, and drink Vodka. </p>
<p> Any of you niggas wanna pull up come to Atco </p>
<p> Back on a serious note, i'm a cool guy (I think) and im always able to talk, if you want. Add me on discord: Aryan#7195
